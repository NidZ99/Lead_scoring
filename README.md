LEAD SCORE CASE STUDY

Project Overview: Enhancing Lead Conversion for X Education


Background:
X Education, an online education provider, attracts many professionals to its website daily. The company advertises its courses across various platforms, including Google. Visitors often engage by browsing courses, filling out forms, or watching videos. Those who provide contact information become 'leads', some of which are also generated through referrals. Despite acquiring numerous leads, X Education faces a low conversion rate, with only about 30% of leads becoming paying customers.
Challenge:
Currently, X Education converts roughly 30 out of every 100 leads. The goal is to improve efficiency by focusing on 'Hot Leads', or those most likely to convert, thereby increasing the overall lead conversion rate.
Objective:
The task is to develop a model that assigns a 'lead score' to each prospect. This score will indicate the likelihood of conversion, helping prioritize potential paying customers. The CEO targets an ambitious 80% lead conversion rate.
Data and Approach:
* The dataset provided contains approximately 9,000 data points, including attributes like Lead Source, Website Engagement, and Last Activity.
* The key outcome variable is 'Converted', indicating past lead conversions.
* The dataset includes categorical variables with a level named 'Select', which is analogous to a null value and needs special attention.
Case Study Goals:
* Construct a logistic regression model to assign lead scores from 0 to 100.
* Ensure the model is adaptable to future changes in the company's requirements.
* Complete the provided document based on the model's outcomes.
Expected Deliverables:
* A comprehensive Jupyter notebook featuring the logistic regression model, conversion predictions, and evaluation metrics.
* A Word document addressing the additional problems set by the company.
* A final presentation detailing:
* The problem statement and analytical approach.
* Business interpretations of the results.
* Key visualizations and summaries of crucial findings.
* A concise 500-word report summarizing the approach, methodology, and key learnings from the assignment.
